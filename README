NAME
    Class::Maker - classes, reflection, schema, serialization, attribute-
    and multiple inheritance

EXAMPLE

	use Class::Maker qw(class);

	class Something;

	class Person,
	{
		isa => [ Something ],

        attributes =>
        {
                scalar => [qw( name age <internal> )],
        },
	};

	sub Person::hello
	{
		my $this = shift;

		$this->_internal( 2123 );

		printf "Here is %s and i am %d years old.\n",  $this->name, $this->age;
	};

	my $p = Person->new( name => Murat, age => 27 );

	$p->hello;

DESCRIPTION
    Class::Maker introduces the concept of classes via a "class" function.
    It automatically creates packages, ISA, new and attribute-handlers. The
    classes can inherit from common perl-classes and class-maker classes.
    Single and multiple and attribute inheritance is supported.

    This package is for everybody who wants to program oo-perl and does not
    really feel comfortable with the common way.

    Java-like reflection is also implemented and allows one to inspect the
    class properties and methods during runtime. This is helpfull for
    implementing persistance and serialization. A Tangram (see cpan) schema
    generator is included to the package, so one can use Tangram
    object-persistance on the fly as long as he uses Class::Maker classes.

	Unfortunately this package has many features, but most of them are not
	really documented yet. But this should change within the next releases.

STATUS
	This is alpha software !

	Do not use this module! Everything, except the basic functionalities
	are still under constant modifications.	Also major parts of the
	documentation is wrong or outdate.
