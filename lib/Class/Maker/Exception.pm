=head1 NAME

Class::Maker::Exception - exceptions tuned for Class::Maker

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Class::Maker qw(class);
	
	use Class::Maker::Exception qw(:try);
		
	{
	package Exception::Child;
	
		Class::Maker::class

			}
		};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is mainly a wrapper to "Error" from CPAN. Because it has a very odd inheritance mechanism, 
this wrapper is needed as a workarround.

=head1 BUGS

Not critical: The "text" attribute is not working. Reading/Writing to it somehow goes into nirvana.
I suppose "Error" has same clue about it. Would suggest to inherit from Class::Maker::Exception and add 
and new "info_text" attribute, which will work.
 
=head1 BASE CLASSES

	{					
		isa => [qw( Error )],
		
		public =>
		{
			string => [qw( text package file )],
